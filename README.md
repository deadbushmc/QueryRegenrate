### QueryRegenrate
Have ever seen servers having 1/2 players and when someone joins it goes to 2/3 players? Then this plugin is for you.

Everytime someone joins the server, the max players count is going to go up by 1.

### Credits
[ItzLucky](https://github.com/NightDevil9440) made this code and told me to publish this to GitHub, so I did.

### Installation
- Go to "server.properties"
- Set "max-players" to 1
- Download and upload this plugin to your plugins folder
- Restart your server
- Done!
